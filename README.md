Hey Team(Erich and Nikoleta), here are the list of libraries you need to add and the list of commands you need to execute before running the code.

#First of all you need to download ubuntu shell for windows, because these commands are linux commands:
#Then:
>pip install flask   #if you don't have pip intall it
>export FLASK_APP=flaskblog.py

>pip install hashlib
>pip install flask_login
>pip install flask-wtf
>pip install wtforms
>pip install flask-sqlalchemy
